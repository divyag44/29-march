    "## **Lasso Regression**, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a regression technique that combines regularization with linear regression. It differs from other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**: Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the OLS objective function, which penalizes the absolute size of coefficients (\\(\\beta\\)). This penalty is controlled by a tuning parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)), which encourages sparsity by shrinking less important predictors' coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: Unlike OLS, which includes all predictors in the model, Lasso Regression can perform feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero. This makes the model more interpretable and reduces overfitting, especially in the presence of many correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Lasso Regression introduces a controlled amount of bias to reduce the variance of the model. This tradeoff helps prevent the model from being too complex and improves its generalization performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Multicollinearity**: Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) by selecting one variable from a group of correlated variables and setting the others to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression stands out by incorporating feature selection through regularization, thereby producing simpler and more interpretable models compared to traditional regression techniques like OLS."

    "## In Lasso Regression, the tuning parameter is typically denoted as \\(\\lambda\\). Adjusting \\(\\lambda\\) affects the model's performance in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\))**: Controls the strength of regularization.\n",
    "   - **High \\(\\lambda\\)**: Increases regularization, leading to more coefficients being shrunk to zero. This simplifies the model but may increase bias.\n",
    "   - **Low \\(\\lambda\\)**: Decreases regularization, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero. This increases model complexity but may improve fit to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interaction with Number of Predictors (p)**: As the number of predictors increases:\n",
    "   - **Higher \\(\\lambda\\)** is generally needed to regularize effectively and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "   - **Lower \\(\\lambda\\)** may be sufficient if there are fewer predictors or if they are not highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact on Bias-Variance Tradeoff**:\n",
    "   - **Increasing \\(\\lambda\\)** increases bias and reduces variance, improving generalization to new data.\n",
    "   - **Decreasing \\(\\lambda\\)** decreases bias but increases variance, potentially leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: \\(\\lambda\\) is often selected using cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation) to find the value that minimizes prediction error on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, adjusting \\(\\lambda\\) in Lasso Regression is crucial for balancing model complexity (number of predictors) with regularization strength, influencing both model interpretability and predictive performance."

    "1. **Penalty Type:**\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression:** Adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients (\\(\\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2\\)).\n",

    "   - Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but they rarely reach exactly zero.\n",
    "   - Lasso regression can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection alongside regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Use Ridge Regression when all predictors are expected to be relevant, and you want to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
